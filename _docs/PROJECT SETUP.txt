### To get started with TEN project you will need to follow further steps: ###

1. Install 'Git Bash' (Download: http://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Acces your workspace and clone project from GIT by writing following command in 'Git Bash' (make sure you have an account)
   git clone git@gitlab.smartsoft.ro:ten/ten.git


To start using this package with all dependencies you will need:

1. Make shure you have 'nodejs' installed
   Check version: In git bash write $ node -v
   Installation:  If you do not have 'nodejs' installed you can download and install it from here: https://nodejs.org/download/
   Version:       Our current version  of 'nodejs' is v0.12.2


2. Make shure you have 'ruby' installed
   Check version: In git bash write $ ruby -v
   Installation:  http://railsinstaller.org/en
   Version: Our   current version of 'ruby' is ruby 2.1.5p273 (2014-11-13 revision 48405) [i386-mingw32]

3. Make sure you have Sass installed
   Check version: In git bash write $ sass -v

We are using Grunt for 4 main reasons:
1. SASS are compiled
2. All CSS files are concatinated and minified in one file
3. All JavaScripts are concatinated and minified in one file
4. Bower dependencies are automatically downloaded

If everything is installed acces ROOT project folder and run following command in git bash

1. npm install // after this command the project should already work as expected

---- if something goes wrong with grunt ------
2. npm install grunt-cli -g //install the grunt if not exists

Following scripts run automatically after npm install:
1. bower install   // install all project dependencies
2. buildcss        // compiles and build SCSS files
3. grunt watch     // watch our .css and .js files for any changes

Only for UI !!!
grunt wiredep // add dependencies to index.html after some bower install (.css in HEADER and .js in FOOTER)
              // you must add at the beginning of each path  "<?php echo home_url(); ?>/"


If you get following Error ECMDERR:

howto fix bower ECMDERR in git bash:
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
